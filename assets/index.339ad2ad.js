      Main component of my formulae is how many people have this map as their top score.
      If a map is easier than other maps, more people in general will have this map as one of their top scores.
      It also accounts for several other things, e.g. how recently a map was ranked, how many people can play at this level, how much playcount this map has, etc.`},{question:"What does the pp number in the map list mean?",answer:`You could notice that the pp number doesn't mean pp for 100% or even pp for 99%. "Maps" page actually shows average pp that people get
      from this map when it's in their top plays. So if a map is often SS'd, then this number will be close to pp for SS. If a map is often passed with a few misses for good pp,
      then pp number will be lower. The reason why I don't just show pp for 99% is that I would need to run pp calculator for thousands of maps (and download all of these maps too),
      and it would take too much time to update the database. So I just use the pp numbers from the scores of players.`},{question:'How is the list of "pp mappers" calculated?',answer:`Mappers' "score" is the sum of overweightness points of every map they made. Whoever has the most total points, wins the golden poopy.
      I try my best to figure out the mappers of guest diffs, but it's not perfect. Every diff is only included once, with the mod combination that has the most overweightness.`},{question:'How is the list of "quality mappers" calculated?',answer:t(r,{children:["Every mapper's score is based on how many favourites from other experienced mappers their maps get.",e("br",{}),'"Experienced mappers" is defined as having 3+ ranked maps.
